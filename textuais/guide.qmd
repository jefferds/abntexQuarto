This guide provides a structured approach to developing a digital twin for a gas turbine using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). It aims to help you define the scope of your model and understand the methodology, particularly relevant for an undergraduate thesis.

\section*{What is a Digital Twin and PINN?}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a physical asset (like your gas turbine) that is updated with real-world data. It can be used to simulate performance, predict failures, and optimize operations.
    \item Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are neural networks that are trained to not only fit data but also to obey the underlying physical laws governing the system. This is achieved by incorporating these physical laws (usually expressed as partial differential equations - PDEs or algebraic equations) into the loss function during training.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step-by-Step Guide to Modeling Your Gas Turbine with PINNs}

\subsection*{Step 1: Define the Scope and Objectives}

Before diving into modeling, clearly define what you want to achieve.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What specific aspects of the turbine do you want to model?} 
    Given your data (Time, T1-T5, P1-P5, Fuel Flow, N1, Thrust), you could model:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Temperature distribution across key stages (T1 to T5).
        \item Pressure changes through the turbine (P1 to P5).
        \item Thrust generation.
        \item The dynamic relationship between inputs (Fuel Flow, N1) and outputs (Temperatures, Pressures, Thrust).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{What questions do you want the digital twin to answer?} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Predict turbine performance (e.g., Thrust, temperatures) under varying operational conditions (Fuel Flow, N1)? 
        \item Understand the sensitivity of outputs to changes in inputs?
    \end{itemize}
    For an undergrad thesis, a focused objective is key. For example: "Predicting steady-state thrust, combustor outlet temperature (T3), and exhaust gas temperature (T5) based on fuel flow and compressor speed (N1), while also predicting intermediate station temperatures and pressures (T2, P2, T4, P4, P3, P5) to ensure thermodynamic consistency through physics-informed loss terms." 
    \item \textbf{Initial Focus with Your Data:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inputs: Fuel Flow (L/hr), N1 (RPM). T1 (C) and P1 (kPa) are crucial inlet/ambient conditions.
        \item Primary Outputs: T3 (C), T5 (C), Thrust (N).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Intermediate Outputs (for Physics Loss): T2 (C), P2 (kPa), P3 (kPa), T4 (C), P4 (kPa), P5 (kPa).
    \item Temporal Aspect: The Time (sec) column allows for modeling dynamic behavior, but you could start with steady-state relationships if that simplifies the initial model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Step 2: Identify Governing Physical Equations}

This is where the "physics-informed" part comes in. You'll need to identify the physical laws relevant to the aspects you're modeling. For a gas turbine, these can be broken down by component. Assume air/gas behaves as an ideal gas. Specific heat capacities () and the ratio of specific heats ($\gamma$) can be assumed constant for simplification, or be temperature-dependent for higher fidelity.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General Thermodynamic Relations:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Ideal Gas Law: $P=\rho RT$ (where R is the specific gas constant). This might be used if density $\rho$ is also modeled or inferred.
        \item Isentropic Process (for ideal compression/expansion): $P_1V_1^\gamma=P_2V_2^\gamma$, $T_1P_1^{1-\gamma}=T_2P_2^{1-\gamma}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Component-Specific Equations (Steady-State):}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Inlet (Station 1):}
        T1, P1 are measured inputs. These serve as boundary conditions for the model.
        \item \textbf{Compressor (Inlet: Station 1, Outlet: Station 2):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature Constraint: T2 $>$ T1.
            \item Pressure Constraint: P2 $>$ P1.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Combustor (Inlet: Station 2, Outlet: Station 3):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature Constraint: T3 $>$ T2.
            \item Pressure Constraint: P3 $<$ P2 (small pressure drop, e.g., P3 $\approx$ (0.95 to 0.98)$\cdot$P2).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Turbine (Inlet: Station 3, Outlet: Station 4):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature Constraint: T4 $<$ T3.
            \item Pressure Constraint: P4 $<$ P3.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Nozzle/Exhaust (Inlet: Station 4, Outlet: Station 5):}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Temperature: Often T5 $\approx$ T4, or a slight drop if there's further expansion for thrust.
            \item Pressure: P5 $<$ P4. P5 is the exhaust pressure, which could be close to ambient (P1) or slightly higher.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Physics Loss Functions (using NN predicted values):}
The physics loss $L_{physics}$ will be the sum of squares of these residuals. Here, $NN_{pred}$ refers to the outputs from your Neural Network (e.g., $T2_{pred}$, $P2_{pred}$, etc.).

\subsection*{1. Compressor Temperature Rise (Isentropic and Actual with Efficiency)}
This combines the ideal isentropic temperature rise and the actual temperature rise considering compressor efficiency ($\eta_c$).

* \textbf{Equation based on ideal isentropic compression:}
    $T_{2s} = T_1 \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_a-1}{\gamma_a}}$
    (Where $\gamma_a$ is the ratio of specific heats for air, e.g., 1.4)

* \textbf{Equation based on actual temperature rise with efficiency:}
    $T_2 = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{\eta_c} \left[ \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_a-1}{\gamma_a}} - 1 \right] \right)$

* \textbf{Loss Function (Residual):}
    We want the predicted $T2$ and $P2$ from the NN to satisfy this relationship.
    $L_{comp\_T} = \left(NN_{T2\_pred} - T_1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{\eta_c} \left[ \left(\frac{NN_{P2\_pred}}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_a-1}{\gamma_a}} - 1 \right] \right)\right)^2$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $T_1$ and $P_1$ are input conditions (measured data).
        \item $\eta_c$ (compressor efficiency) can be assumed (e.g., 0.8-0.9) or made a learnable parameter for your PINN.
        \item $\gamma_a$ is the specific heat ratio for air.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Turbine Temperature Drop (Isentropic and Actual with Efficiency)}
Similar to the compressor, this accounts for the ideal and actual temperature drop across the turbine.

* \textbf{Equation based on ideal isentropic expansion:}
    $T_{4s} = T_3 \left(\frac{P_4}{P_3}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_g-1}{\gamma_g}}$
    (Where $\gamma_g$ is the ratio of specific heats for combustion gases)

* \textbf{Equation based on actual temperature drop with efficiency:}
    $T_4 = T_3 \left(1 - \eta_t \left[1 - \left(\frac{P_4}{P_3}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_g-1}{\gamma_g}}\right] \right)$

* \textbf{Loss Function (Residual):}
    $L_{turb\_T} = \left(NN_{T4\_pred} - T_3 \left(1 - \eta_t \left[1 - \left(\frac{NN_{P4\_pred}}{P_3}\right)^{\frac{\gamma_g-1}{\gamma_g}}\right] \right)\right)^2$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $T_3$ and $P_3$ are intermediate outputs predicted by the NN, but for the turbine equation, they act as inputs to this specific physical relationship.
        \item $\eta_t$ (turbine efficiency) can be assumed (e.g., 0.85-0.95) or made a learnable parameter.
        \item $\gamma_g$ is the specific heat ratio for combustion gases.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Power Balance (Compressor-Turbine Matching)}
This is a critical constraint for steady-state operation, ensuring the power produced by the turbine is sufficient to drive the compressor and accessories.

* \textbf{Simplified Equation:}
    $\dot{m}_a c_{p_a} (T_2 - T_1) \approx (\dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} (T_3 - T_4) \eta_m$

* \textbf{Loss Function (Residual):}
    $L_{power\_bal} = \left(\dot{m}_a c_{p_a} (NN_{T2\_pred} - T_1) - (\dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} (NN_{T3\_pred} - NN_{T4\_pred}) \eta_m\right)^2$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\dot{m}_a$ (air mass flow rate) can be challenging. You might initially treat it as a learnable parameter or establish an empirical relationship with N1, P1, T1.
        \item $\dot{m}_f$ (fuel mass flow rate) is derived from Fuel Flow (L/hr) and fuel density, requiring conversion to kg/s.
        \item $c_{p_a}$ (specific heat of air at constant pressure) and $c_{p_g}$ (specific heat of combustion gases) can be assumed constant.
        \item $\eta_m$ (mechanical efficiency) can be assumed.
        \item This links $T_1, T_2, T_3, T_4$ and mass flow rates, providing a strong constraint.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Combustor Energy Balance (Simplified)}
This equation relates the heat added by the fuel to the increase in enthalpy of the gases flowing through the combustor.

* \textbf{Equation:}
    $(\dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} T_3 - \dot{m}_a c_{p_a} T_2 = \dot{m}_f Q_{HV} \eta_b$

* \textbf{Loss Function (Residual):}
    $L_{comb\_E} = \left((\dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} NN_{T3\_pred} - \dot{m}_a c_{p_a} NN_{T2\_pred} - \dot{m}_f Q_{HV} \eta_b\right)^2$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\dot{m}_a$ and $\dot{m}_f$ are as defined above.
        \item $Q_{HV}$ (Lower Heating Value of fuel) is a constant.
        \item $\eta_b$ (combustor efficiency) can be assumed (e.g., 0.95-0.99, or learnable).
        \item $c_{p_a}$ and $c_{p_g}$ are specific heats.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{5. Thrust Equation (Simplified Conceptual Form)}
While the full thrust equation is complex, a simplified form can be used as a physics loss term, especially if T5 is the temperature after expansion in the nozzle.

* \textbf{Simplified Model (Enthalpy Drop):}
    $F \propto (\dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} (T_4 - T_5)$ 

* \textbf{Loss Function (Residual):}
    To make this a squared residual, you might compare a scaled version of this with the predicted thrust, or use a more direct relationship if available. A simple proportionality:
    $L_{thrust} = \left(NN_{Thrust\_pred} - K \cdot (\dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f) c_{p_g} (NN_{T4\_pred} - NN_{T5\_pred})\right)^2$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $K$ would be a scaling constant or a learnable parameter.
        \item This provides a way to enforce consistency between the predicted thrust and the energy drop in the exhaust, linking it to the predicted temperatures and mass flows.
    \end{itemize}

\section*{Choosing Physical Equations for an Undergrad Thesis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Don't aim for full CFD. Focus on algebraic equations representing key thermodynamic principles.
    \item Clearly state assumptions (e.g., constant specific heats, values for efficiencies if not learned, ideal gas behavior).
    \item The mass flow rate of air ($\dot{m}_a$) can be challenging. You might initially:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Treat it as a learnable parameter for each data point (less ideal).
        \item Try to establish an empirical relationship with N1 and P1, T1 from literature for similar turbines.
        \item Formulate some physics loss terms using specific work/energy to make them less dependent on $\dot{m}_a$, or use ratios where it might cancel.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
This step-by-step approach, now with more detailed equation examples, should provide a solid framework for your thesis. Remember to start with a manageable scope and iteratively build complexity. Good luck! 

\section*{Step 3: Data Preparation and Preprocessing}

Your provided data snippet looks fairly clean. General steps include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cleaning: Handle any missing values or outliers (if any in the full dataset).
    \item Unit Conversion: Ensure all units are consistent (e.g., temperatures in Kelvin for thermodynamic equations, pressures in Pascals). Fuel Flow (L/hr) needs conversion to kg/s.
    \item Normalization/Scaling: Neural networks train best with normalized data (e.g., scaling inputs and outputs to a range like [0, 1] or [-1, 1] or using z-score normalization). Keep track of scaling factors to revert predictions to original units.
    \item Data Splitting: Divide your dataset into: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Training set (to train the PINN).
        \item Validation set (to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting).
        \item Test set (to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Time Series Handling (if modeling dynamics): 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You might use a sliding window approach to create input sequences if using recurrent layers or feed-forward networks with time as an input.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 4: Design the PINN Architecture}

A PINN typically consists of: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Neural Network (NN) Component:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Usually a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
        \item Inputs: e.g., Fuel Flow, N1, T1, P1. If modeling dynamics, Time would also be an input.
        \item Outputs: T2, P2, T3, P3, T4, P4, T5, P5, Thrust.
        \item You'll need to decide on:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Number of hidden layers.
            \item Number of neurons per layer.
            \item Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Tanh, SiLU/Swish).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Physics-Informed Loss Function:} This is the crucial part. The total loss is a combination of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Data Loss ($L_{data}$):} Measures the discrepancy between the NN's predictions and your measured data.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Typically Mean Squared Error (MSE): $L_{data} = \frac{1}{N_{data}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{data}}(Y_{predicted,i}-Y_{actual,i})^2$.
            \item Applied to your sensor data points (e.g., for T1-T5, P1-P5, Thrust).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Physics Loss ($L_{physics}$):} Penalizes deviations from the governing physical equations identified in Step 2.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The NN outputs (and their derivatives, obtained via automatic differentiation) are substituted into the physical equations.
            \item The residuals of these equations (how far they are from being zero) form this loss component.
            \item This is applied at collocation points (which can be the data points themselves, or additional points sampled from the input domain).
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Boundary/Initial Condition Loss ($L_{bc/ic}$):} (If applicable) Enforces known conditions.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Your T1 and P1 are input conditions.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Total Loss:} $L_{total} = w_{data}L_{data} + w_{physics}L_{physics}$ (plus $w_{bc/ic}L_{bc/ic}$ if explicitly separated).
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $w_{data}$, $w_{physics}$ are weights that balance the contribution of each loss term. These often require tuning.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 5: Training the PINN}
Once trained, rigorously evaluate your PINN: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimizer:} Choose an optimization algorithm (e.g., Adam, L-BFGS). Adam is common for initial training, L-BFGS can be good for fine-tuning in PINNs.
    \item \textbf{Automatic Differentiation:} Leverage this feature in deep learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch) to compute derivatives of NN outputs with respect to inputs if your PDEs/ODEs require them (e.g., $\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}, \frac{\partial P}{\partial x}$). For the algebraic equations listed, direct output values are used.
    \item \textbf{Training Process:} The NN parameters are adjusted iteratively to minimize the Ltotal.
    \item \textbf{Monitoring:} Track training and validation loss. Observe how well both data fitting and physics satisfaction are progressing.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 6: Evaluation and Validation}

Once trained, rigorously evaluate your PINN: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Test Set Performance:} Use the unseen test data to assess predictive accuracy (e.g., using metrics like MSE, MAE, R2 score for each output).
    \item \textbf{Physical Consistency:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do the predicted profiles (e.g., temperature along the turbine) make physical sense and respect the constraints? 
        \item How well are the physical residuals minimized on the test data and other collocation points? 
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Comparison:} If possible, compare against purely data-driven models or existing simulation results.
    \item \textbf{Sensitivity Analysis:} Explore how the model predictions change with variations in input parameters.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 7: Refinement and Iteration (Important for Thesis)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Start simple and gradually add complexity.
    \item You might begin by modeling only a subset of parameters or using only a few simple physical constraints (e.g., T2 $>$ T1).
    \item Iteratively refine your NN architecture, loss function weights, and the set of physical equations.
    \item Document your choices, justifications, and results at each stage. For instance, if you assume certain efficiencies ($\eta_c, \eta_t$), state these clearly. If you make them learnable, discuss how their learned values compare to typical ranges.
\end{itemize}

\section*{What to Model with Your Specific Data - A Focused Starting Point:}

Given your data (Time, T1-T5, P1-P5, Fuel Flow, N1, Thrust):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Objective: Predict primary outputs T3, T5, Thrust. Also predict intermediate values T2, P2, P3, T4, P4, P5 to enforce physical consistency.
    \item NN Inputs: Fuel Flow (converted to kg/s), N1 (RPM), T1 (K), P1 (Pa).
    \item NN Outputs: T2\_pred (K), P2\_pred (Pa), T3\_pred (K), P3\_pred (Pa), T4\_pred (K), P4\_pred (Pa), T5\_pred (K), P5\_pred (Pa), Thrust\_pred (N).
\end{enumerate}
