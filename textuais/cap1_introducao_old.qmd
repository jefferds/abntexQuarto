Quarto allows you to weave content and executable code into a final document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

# Using figures

An example of a figure is @fig-peixe below.

::: {#fig-peixe layout-ncol=1}

## Tables

Tables are used to display tabular data. An example of a table is @tbl-1 below.

| Name  | Age | Gender |
|-------|-----|--------|
| John  | 20  | M      |
| Mary  | 25  | F      |

: Example of a table: people data {#tbl-1}

## Equations

Black-Scholes (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm C^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}

## Code in Julia

Below is some code in Julia:

<!-- Here I had to do a workaround because I couldn't get the code to run correctly in quarto.org. I used \vspace{0cm} and it worked at the time. -->

\vspace{0cm}

```{#lst-1 .julia lst-cap="Customers Query"}
x = 1 + 1
```

This was an example of support for figures, tables, equations, and code in Julia. For more information about support for figures, tables, equations, and code (@lst-1) in Julia, see <https://quarto.org>.

```{#lst-2 .julia lst-cap="Example of Julia code"}
x = 1 + 1
```

This was an example of support for figures, tables, equations, and code in Julia (@lst-2).

## Citing references

Here is an example of citing references:

Citing references is done as follows: @grote2009springer
