\chapter{\textbf{Materials and Methods}}

This chapter details the methodology for developing a Level 1 digital twin for a laboratory-scale gas turbine. The approach integrates first-principle thermodynamic models with a data-driven framework using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The primary objective is to create a robust and physically consistent model capable of predicting the turbine's performance under various operating conditions. The methodology encompasses several key stages: establishing the mathematical model from fundamental thermodynamic laws, leveraging experimental data for training and validation, implementing the hybrid PINN architecture, and rigorously evaluating the final digital twin's predictive accuracy and physical fidelity. This structured approach ensures that the resulting digital twin is not only accurate but also grounded in the underlying physics of the gas turbine system.

# Experimental Setup and Data Acquisition

The physical asset central to this investigation is the Mini-Lab Gas Turbine Power System, which is based on the SR-30 turbojet engine. This system is purpose-built for educational and experimental applications, allowing for the simulation and detailed analysis of core gas turbine operations and thermodynamic cycles on a laboratory scale.

## System Overview and Instrumentation

The SR-30 engine is configured as a single-shaft turbojet, comprising a centrifugal compressor, an annular combustion chamber, an axial turbine, and a nozzle. To facilitate comprehensive operational monitoring and data acquisition, the engine is extensively instrumented with a variety of sensors. These sensors provide high-resolution, real-time data on critical thermodynamic and performance parameters.

The instrumentation setup includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compressor Inlet Pressure ($\mathrm{P}_{1}$) and Temperature ($\mathrm{T}_{1}$).
    \item Compressor Exit Pressure ($\mathrm{P}_{2}$) and Temperature ($\mathrm{T}_{2}$).
    \item Turbine Inlet Pressure ($\mathrm{P}_{3}$) and Temperature ($\mathrm{T}_{3}$).
    \item Turbine Exit Pressure ($\mathrm{P}_{4}$) and Temperature ($\mathrm{T}_{4}$).
    \item Exhaust Gas Pressure ($\mathrm{P}_{5}$) and Temperature ($\mathrm{T}_{5}$).
    \item Compressor Rotational Speed (RPM), measured by a tachometer generator.
    \item Fuel Pressure and Fuel Flow.
    \item Engine Thrust, measured via a dedicated load cell.
\end{itemize}
These parameters are displayed on the system's control panel and, more extensively, on a connected Data Acquisition Screen. Specifically, $\mathrm{P}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ (Turbine Inlet Temperature, displayed as TIT) are available on both the panel and screen, while $\mathrm{T}_{5}$ (Exhaust Gas Temperature, displayed as EGT) is also accessible from both. Fuel Pressure is displayed on the panel. The precise location of these engine sensors is depicted in the SR-30 Gas Turbine Cutaway diagram within the Mini-Lab's operational manual.

## Data Acquisition System and Control Interface

The data acquisition process is managed through a dedicated Data Acquisition Computer running the MiniLab 1.1 software. This computer connects to the Mini-Lab system via a USB port, leveraging a National Instruments DAQ (Data Acquisition) system (specifically the NI DAQ 6218 module) for real-time data capture and display. The MiniLab 1.1 software facilitates logging data to file, displaying plot features, and offers controls for unit toggling (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit for temperatures, Psig to kPa for pressures, Liters/hour or Gallons/hour for fuel flow, and Newtons to Pounds for thrust). The data sampling rate can be selected between 0.1 and 5 samples per second.

## Experimental Procedure and Data Collection Protocol

The experimental procedure involved operating the Mini-Lab gas turbine through its pre-start, start-up, and operational phases, followed by a controlled shutdown. Prior to each run, essential checks were conducted, including verification of fuel properties and ambient barometric pressure. During operation, the MiniLab 1.1 software collected real-time data from various sensors, including temperatures, pressures, fuel flow, RPM, and thrust. This data was logged continuously to a file on the connected computer's hard drive via a USB connection to a National Instruments DAQ system. The software allowed for adjustable sampling rates, and the recorded data was stored in an ASCII format, enabling direct import into spreadsheet programs for subsequent detailed analysis.

# Thermodynamic Modeling of the Gas Turbine System

## System Overview

The system of interest is a small-scale gas turbine engine operating in steady-state. It consists of the following major components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Compressor}: Increases the pressure and temperature of incoming ambient air.
    \item \textbf{Combustor}: Mixes compressed air with fuel, where combustion raises the temperature significantly.
    \item \textbf{Turbine}: Extracts energy from the hot combustion gases to drive the compressor and generate useful work.
    \item \textbf{Nozzle (Exhaust Section)}: Accelerates the exhaust gases to produce thrust.
\end{itemize}

Each component operates under the assumption of quasi-one-dimensional, steady, adiabatic flow, with negligible heat loss to the surroundings unless explicitly modeled.

## Assumptions and Idealizations

To derive tractable analytical expressions and guide neural network constraints, the following assumptions are adopted:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The working fluid (air and combustion gases) behaves as a \textbf{calorically perfect ideal gas}:
$$
    P = \rho R T, \quad c_p, c_v \text{ constant}, \quad \gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v} \approx 1.4
$$

    \item \textbf{Isentropic relations} apply to ideal compression and expansion processes with specified efficiencies $\eta_c$ (compressor) and $\eta_t$ (turbine).
    \item \textbf{Constant specific heats} $c_p$ and $c_v$ are used, consistent with the assumption of ideal gases.
    \item \textbf{No heat transfer or pressure losses} in ducts, except where captured by model residuals.
    \item \textbf{Steady-state} and \textbf{quasi-1D flow} are assumed throughout.
\end{itemize}

## Key Thermodynamic Equations

### Compressor

\begin{itemize}
    \item Isentropic temperature relation:
$$
    \frac{T_{2s}}{T_1} = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
$$

    \item Actual outlet temperature considering efficiency:
$$
    T_2 = T_1 + \frac{T_{2s} - T_1}{\eta_c}
$$

    \item Power required by the compressor:
$$
    W_{\text{comp}} = \dot{m}_a c_p (T_2 - T_1)
$$

\end{itemize}

### Combustor

\begin{itemize}
    \item Energy balance (idealized with complete combustion and no heat losses):
$$
    \dot{m}_f Q_{\text{HV}} = \dot{m}_g c_p (T_3 - T_2)
$$

    where $Q_{\text{HV}}$ is the lower heating value of the fuel and $\dot{m}_g = \dot{m}_a + \dot{m}_f$ is the total mass flow after combustion.
\end{itemize}

### Turbine

\begin{itemize}
    \item Isentropic temperature relation:
$$
    \frac{T_{4s}}{T_3} = \left( \frac{P_4}{P_3} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
$$

    \item Actual outlet temperature considering turbine efficiency:
$$
    T_4 = T_3 - \eta_t (T_3 - T_{4s})
$$

    \item Power generated by the turbine:
$$
    W_{\text{turb}} = \dot{m}_g c_p (T_3 - T_4)
$$

\end{itemize}

### Nozzle (Exhaust)

Assuming isentropic expansion and ambient back pressure $P_0$, the exhaust velocity is:
$$
V_{\text{exit}} = \sqrt{2 c_p T_5 \left( 1 - \left( \frac{P_0}{P_5} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} \right)}
$$

The thrust is then calculated via momentum balance:
$$
F = \dot{m}_g (V_{\text{exit}} - V_{\text{inlet}})
$$

If inlet velocity is negligible (static tests), this simplifies to:
$$
F \approx \dot{m}_g V_{\text{exit}}
$$

## Station Numbering Convention

To standardize variables across the PINN and thermodynamic sections:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$1$ & Ambient conditions (inlet to compressor) \\
$2$ & Compressor exit / combustor inlet \\
$3$ & Combustor exit / turbine inlet \\
$4$ & Turbine exit / nozzle inlet \\
$5$ & Nozzle exit (exhaust gas temperature station)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

This convention allows the PINN to learn both the observable outputs ($T_3$, $T_5$, $F$) and intermediate station states ($T_2$, $P_2$, $T_4$, $P_4$, etc.), constrained by physics-based residuals.









# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Framework

To bridge the gap between purely data-driven models and first-principle simulations, this work employs a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to model the gas turbine system.

## Core Concept

PINNs are neural networks that embed physical laws directly into their training process. Rather than minimizing only the error between model predictions and experimental data, the PINN loss function also includes terms that penalize violations of governing physical equations. This approach ensures that predictions are both data-accurate and physically consistent, even in regions where data is sparse.

## PINN Architecture

The core model is a fully connected Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) trained to learn mappings from inputs to thermodynamic states and performance metrics. The architecture is guided by simplifying assumptions from thermodynamics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Air is modeled as a calorically perfect ideal gas with constant specific heats ($c_p$, $c_v$) and a constant heat capacity ratio $\gamma = c_p / c_v \approx 1.4$.
    \item Isentropic efficiencies for the compressor ($\eta_c$) and turbine ($\eta_t$) are assumed constant.
    \item Heat losses, frictional effects, and pressure drops outside of defined station points are neglected.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Inputs}: Key operational parameters that determine the thermodynamic state of the system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fuel flow rate $\dot{m}_f$ ($\mathrm{kg/s}$)
    \item Compressor rotational speed $N_1$ (RPM)
    \item Ambient temperature $T_1$ (K)
    \item Ambient pressure $P_1$ (Pa)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outputs}: Predicted thermodynamic variables and performance indicators:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Station states: $\hat{T}_2, \hat{P}_2, \hat{T}_3, \hat{P}_3, \hat{T}_4, \hat{P}_4, \hat{T}_5, \hat{P}_5$
    \item Net thrust $\hat{F}$ (N)
\end{itemize}





## Hybrid Loss Function

The total loss used to train the PINN is a weighted sum of data-driven and physics-based components:
$$
L_{\text{total}} = w_{\text{data}} L_{\text{data}} + w_{\text{physics}} L_{\text{physics}}
$$

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Loss} ($L_{\text{data}}$): A supervised learning loss (Mean Squared Error) that penalizes deviation from available experimental measurements:
$$
    L_{\text{data}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( y_i - \hat{y}_i \right)^2
$$
    
    \item \textbf{Physics Loss} ($L_{\text{physics}}$): A sum of residuals derived from physical principles, each enforcing thermodynamic consistency.
\end{itemize}

### Compressor Temperature Rise Loss ($L_{T2}$)

Derived from the isentropic temperature relation:
$$
\frac{\hat{T}_2}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{1}{\eta_c} \left( \left( \frac{\hat{P}_2}{P_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right)
$$

This is rearranged into a residual form:
$$
L_{T2} = \left( \eta_c (\hat{T}_2 - T_1) - T_1 \left( \left(\frac{\hat{P}_2}{P_1}\right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}} - 1 \right) \right)^2
$$

### Turbine Temperature Drop Loss ($L_{T4}$)

Enforcing the relationship between pressure drop and temperature drop across the turbine:
$$
L_{T4} = \left( (\hat{T}_3 - \hat{T}_4) - \eta_t \hat{T}_3 \left(1 - \left(\frac{\hat{P}_4}{\hat{P}_3}\right)^{\frac{\gamma-1}{\gamma}}\right) \right)^2
$$

### Compressor Power Balance Loss ($L_{\text{comp}}$)

Assuming the compressor is driven by the turbine on the same shaft:
$$
L_{\text{comp}} = \left( \dot{m}_a c_p (\hat{T}_2 - T_1) - W_{\text{comp}} \right)^2
$$

### Turbine Power Balance Loss ($L_{\text{turb}}$)

$$
L_{\text{turb}} = \left( \dot{m}_g c_p (\hat{T}_3 - \hat{T}_4) - W_{\text{turb}} \right)^2
$$
A constraint $W_{\text{turb}} \approx W_{\text{comp}}$ can be added as an auxiliary residual.

### Combustor Energy Balance Loss ($L_{\text{comb}}$)

Assuming ideal heat release with no losses:
$$
L_{\text{comb}} = \left( \dot{m}_f Q_{\text{HV}} - \dot{m}_g c_p (\hat{T}_3 - \hat{T}_2) \right)^2
$$

### Thrust Loss

A simplified thrust estimation (using momentum conservation) could also be encoded if exit velocity and intake velocity are known or modeled:
$$
L_{\text{thrust}} = \left( \hat{F} - \dot{m}_g (V_{\text{exit}} - V_{\text{inlet}}) \right)^2
$$

Where $\dot{m}_g$ (mass flow of combustion gases) can either be estimated from $N_1$ and ambient conditions or treated as a learnable parameter.






# Digital Twin Development and Evaluation

## Problem Definition

The primary goal of this thesis is to build a digital twin capable of predicting steady-state thrust, combustor outlet temperature ($\hat{T}_3$), and exhaust gas temperature ($\hat{T}_5$) based on operational inputs: fuel flow rate and compressor speed ($N_1$). Intermediate variables—such as $\hat{T}_2$, $\hat{P}_2$, $\hat{T}_4$, $\hat{P}_4$, $\hat{P}_3$, and $\hat{P}_5$—are also predicted to ensure thermodynamic consistency via physics-informed residual losses.

## Data Preparation and Preprocessing

The experimental dataset is preprocessed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cleaning}: Missing values are handled, and outliers are identified and removed.
    \item \textbf{Unit Conversion}: All quantities are converted to SI units (e.g., temperatures in Kelvin, pressures in Pascals, fuel flow in $\mathrm{kg/s}$).
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Input and output features are scaled (e.g., to $[0, 1]$) to improve training stability.
    \item \textbf{Data Splitting}: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for unbiased evaluation.
\end{itemize}

## Training and Validation

The PINN is trained using gradient-based optimizers (e.g., Adam and L-BFGS), enabled by automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow). Evaluation of model performance involves three key dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Predictive Accuracy}: Assessed via Mean Squared Error (MSE) and $R^2$ score on test data.
    \item \textbf{Physical Consistency}: Measured by evaluating the magnitude of physics loss terms across the test set.
    \item \textbf{Sensitivity Analysis}: Conducted to examine how predictions respond to variations in fuel flow and compressor speed, and to identify dominant factors influencing performance.
\end{itemize}

This iterative cycle of training, validation, and physics-based refinement continues until the model achieves both data accuracy and alignment with physical laws.
