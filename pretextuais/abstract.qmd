ABSTRACT
\end{center}

The Organic Rankine Cycle is an energy generation process that uses an organic thermal fluid, such as methane, as a working medium. It is composed of a series of components that work together to convert the thermal energy of the fluid into mechanical energy, which is in turn converted into electrical energy through a generator.
